## Traditional ticketing system problems
1. Ticket fraud: Traditional paper tickets can be easily duplicated or forged, leading to ticket fraud and loss of revenue for event organizers.
2. Scalping: Scalpers often buy tickets in bulk and resell them at inflated prices, taking advantage of fans who are willing to pay more to attend an event.
3. Lack of transparency: Traditional ticketing systems often lack transparency, making it difficult for buyers to know if they are purchasing legitimate tickets and for event organizers to track ticket sales.
4. Limited options for event organizers: Traditional ticketing systems often restrict event organizers to a limited set of ticketing options, limiting their ability to customize the ticketing experience for their fans.

## Project description
- Introducing a revolutionary new decentralized marketplace for the creation, sale, and purchase of tickets that are represented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Our platform offers a secure and efficient way for event organizers, performers, and artists to easily mint their own NFT tickets, and for buyers to purchase them with ease.
- With our platform, sellers can create unique, one-of-a-kind NFT tickets that cannot be replicated or counterfeited, ensuring the authenticity and validity of each ticket sold. Buyers can rest assured that they are purchasing legitimate tickets for their desired event, with the added benefit of having a digital collectible that can be traded or resold in the future.
- This decentralized marketplace is built on blockchain technology, providing an immutable and transparent ledger of all transactions. This allows for complete transparency and eliminates the possibility of fraudulent activity, ensuring a fair and honest marketplace for all users.
- In addition, **ticket.store** platform offers a user-friendly interface, making it easy for both buyers and sellers to navigate and use. Intuitive tools allow buyers to quickly find the NFT ticket they are looking for, while sellers can easily manage their inventory and sales.
- With our decentralized NFT ticket marketplace, we are changing the way tickets are bought and sold.

## Use case example
- John is a music promoter who is organizing a music festival in his city. He decides to use the decentralized NFT ticket marketplace to sell tickets for the festival. He creates NFT tickets for each day of the festival and sets the price for each ticket.
- He uploads the NFT tickets to the marketplace, which automatically verifies the authenticity of each ticket and adds them to the marketplace's inventory. The marketplace uses blockchain technology to ensure that the tickets cannot be duplicated or forged, providing security for both the promoter and the buyers.
- As the festival approaches, music fans start buying the NFT tickets from the marketplace. The buyers are excited to have a digital collectible that represents their ticket to the event, and they can easily resell the ticket on the marketplace if they are unable to attend the festival.
- On the day of the festival, John uses the marketplace to scan the NFT tickets at the entrance, ensuring that only valid tickets are allowed into the event. The blockchain ledger tracks all transactions, providing a transparent and immutable record of all ticket sales.
- Overall, the decentralized marketplace for minting, selling, and buying NFT tickets provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for event organizers and buyers alike. It offers an innovative solution to traditional ticketing that benefits all parties involved.

## Biggest challenge
- The biggest challenge when creating the **ticket.store** smart contract was to fully understand the FA2 library and use it in the marketplace smart contract.

## Security
- This contract was not audited by any company, but it was created by knowing what are the main flaws and security issues in most smart contracts
